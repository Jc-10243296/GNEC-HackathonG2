<h1>Water Pollution and it's Impact</h1>
    <div class = "part1">  
        <div class= "p-container1">
            <p> &emsp;Water pollution is a growing environmental crisis, with oceans being one of its most affected ecosystems. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste, chemicals, and untreated sewage find their way into the ocean, threatening marine life and disrupting the delicate balance of aquatic ecosystems. Pollutants such as oil spills, agricultural runoff, and microplastics contaminate the water, making it toxic for marine creatures and threatening the health of coral reefs, fish, and even the humans who rely on seafood for sustenance. The accumulation of these pollutants not only harms biodiversity but also damages the ocean's ability to regulate climate, as healthy oceans play a vital role in absorbing carbon dioxide. Without urgent action to reduce pollution and protect marine environments, the oceans will continue to suffer, and so will the many species, including humans, who depend on them.
